        your new value in parenthesis
        
        ```
        Usage: complicated <Complicated API Key> <complication type> "<New Value>"
        Example:
        complciated abcd1234 modularLarge "Hello World\nCan you see me"
        ```
        
        Arguments:
         - `API Key`: You can get this from the settings page in the Complicated app
         - `Complication Type`: The complication that you want to update to the new value.
        Here is a list of the available types: [ circularSmall, extraLarge, graphicBezel, graphicCorner, graphicRectangular, modularLarge, modularSmall, utilitarianLarge, utilitarianSmall ]
         - `New Value`: The new value to change the complciation to. Surround it with quotes if you want to include spaces. Use \n for new lines.
        
        
        ## How to use the Python Library

        ```python
        from complicated import changeComplication
        
        # Usage: changeComplication( '<api key>', '<complication type>', '<new value>' )
